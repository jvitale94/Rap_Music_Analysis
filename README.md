# Rap_Music_Analysis

This was my final project for CS 585 Intro to Natural Language Processing at UMASS Amherst in the Fall of 2016. It includes the webscraper I made that downloaded lyrics from azlyrics.com, the word2vec model (downloaded from tensorflow) that I used to make the word embeddings, and the python script I wrote to analyze the embeddings as well as perform various other NLP analyses. My results as well as my written report are included as well.
